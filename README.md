# x5gon prototype 03

User interface sketch for X5gon project

## Use scenario

Unlike [prototype 02](https://github.com/stefankreitmayer/x5_02_trays), this one focuses on the learner. There is no curator role. Instead, given a limited pool of OERs, the learner's profile is used to filter, organise, and sort recommendations. Recommendations can be entire OERs or fragments thereof.

As a learner, when I go to the homepage I want to...
- [x] see a wide range of recommended items categorised in playlists with useful headings that explain the rationale why they were recommended
- [x] mark an item as started
- [x] see all the items that I have started
- [x] mark an item as done
- [x] see a history of what I've done
- [ ] find a video podcast under either "videos" or "podcasts" or both; same for audio podcasts consistently
- [ ] see all the items that I have started but haven't touched in a while

As a learner, when I see a recommendation in a playlist...
- [x] in order to recognise the resource I want to see its title and image
- [ ] in order to improve future recommendations I want to mark the recommendation as helpful or unhelpful
- [ ] if the item is about a fragment (rather than a whole resource), then I also want to see the exact time/page/paragraph range

As a learner, when I select a recommendation from a playlist...
- [x] in order to use the resource, I want to get a link to it (ideally to the specific play/text position if given)

As a learner, when I mark a recommendation as unhelpful...
- [ ] in order to improve future recommendations I want to state the reason, e.g. broken link, inaccurate, crap quality, doesn't fit my goals, doesn't fit my preferences, ...

As a learner who cannot scroll horizontally...
- [ ] I want to use buttons to see more playlist items than fit my screen

As a learner, in order to feel motivated, when I mark an item as progressed or done...
- [ ] I want to see a happy, fireworksy animation like in khan academy when I pass a quiz

As a learner, in order to benefit from peer motivation...
- [ ] I want to share my progress with another person (not necessarily a user)

## Build instructions

Same as [prototype 01](https://github.com/stefankreitmayer/x5_01_metacourse)

## Thoughts about interface design

The new Netflix for open education?

Should we say "useful" or "helpful"?
