# x5gon prototype 03

User interface sketch for X5gon project

## Use scenario

Unlike [prototype 02](https://github.com/stefankreitmayer/x5_02_trays), this one focuses on the learner. There is no curator role. Instead, given a limited pool of OERs, the learner's profile is used to filter, organise, and sort recommendations. Recommendations can be entire OERs or fragments thereof.

As a learner, when I go to the homepage I want to...
- [x] see a wide range of recommended items categorised in playlists with useful headings that explain the rationale why they were recommended
- [x] mark an item as started
- [x] see all the items that I have started
- [x] mark an item as done
- [x] see a history of what I've done
- [ ] find a video podcast under either "videos" or "podcasts" or both; same for audio podcasts consistently
- [ ] see all the items that I have started but haven't touched in a while
- [x] see a happy greeting like "welcome back [my first name]" or something like that
- [ ] switch to one of my other learning projects, e.g. fitness, rock climbing, tai chi, squash, comedy writing, etc
- [ ] have a button next to each playlist allowing me to improve the recommendations
- [ ] see a number of plants in pots (e.g. information, exercise, apply in practice) with their shapes indicating how recently I've attended each aspect, or whether I've been negligent.
- [ ] see a number of "hot picks" based on my profile and history
- [ ] edit my learning goals, learning preferences, and prior knowledge
- [ ] know which maths and programming skills I need to acquire in order to achieve my learning goals

As a learner, when I see a recommendation...
- [x] in order to recognise the resource I want to see its title and image
- [ ] in order to improve future recommendations I want to mark the recommendation as helpful or unhelpful
- [ ] if the item is about a fragment (rather than a whole resource), then I also want to see the exact time/page/paragraph range

As a learner, when I select a recommendation...
- [x] in order to use the resource, I want to get a link to it (ideally to the specific play/text position if given)
- [x] in order to use the resource conveniently, when the resource is a video I want to play it in an embedded player (ideally from the specific play position if given)
- [x] in order to evaluate the resource, I want to see "what users said" (e.g. star rating table for funny, engaging, practical, etc.)
- [x] in order to evaluate the resource, I want to see "what our algorithm thinks", i.e. why the item was recommended
- [ ] in order to improve future recommendations, I want to give my own opinions about e.g. funny, engaging, practical, simple language, etc.
- [ ] in order to improve future recommendations, I want to write a free text feedback comment
- [ ] in order to improve future recommendations, I want to report a problem
- [ ] in order to get instant help and improve future recommendations, I want to say "I didn't quite understand this bit" or "This is way too easy for me"

As a learner, when I mark a recommendation as unhelpful...
- [x] in order to improve future recommendations I want to select the reason, e.g. broken link, inaccurate, crap quality, doesn't fit my goals, doesn't fit my preferences, ...
- [ ] in order to improve future recommendations I want to type my reason as free text

As a learner who cannot scroll horizontally...
- [x] I want to use buttons to see more playlist items than fit my screen

As a learner, when I completed an item that has a sequel (e.g. next podcast episode, or video part 2 of 8 etc)
- [ ] in order to progress easily and maintain logical flow, I want to mark it as completed AND start the sequel (is this a good idea? the best "next" should depend on entire history, innit?)
- [ ] in order to feel motivated, I want to see a happy, fireworksy animation like in khan academy when I pass a quiz

As a learner, in order to benefit from peer motivation...
- [ ] I want to share my progress with another person (not necessarily a user)


## Mockup data

Similar to [prototype 01](https://github.com/stefankreitmayer/x5_01_metacourse)

## Build instructions

Same as [prototype 01](https://github.com/stefankreitmayer/x5_01_metacourse)

## Thoughts about interface design

The new Netflix for open education?

Should we say "useful" or "helpful"?
